/* 
1.) Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent
 an invoice for an item sold at the store. 
2.) An Invoice should include four pieces of information as instance variables: 
 a part number (type String), a part description (type String), a quantity of the 
 item being purchased (type int) and a price per item (double). 
3.) Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four instance variables. Provide a set 
  and a get method for each instance variable. 
4.) In addition, provide a method named getInvoiceAmount that calculates the invoice 
  amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per item), then returns 
  the amount as a double value. If the quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. If the price per 
  item is not positive, it should be set to 0.0. 
5.) Write a test app named InvoiceTest that demonstrates class Invoiceâ€™s capabilities.
